U-Boot PKGBUILD for RockPro64

utilizes u-boot mainline according to the Rockchip bootflow with u-boot as TPL/SPL and ARM Trusted Firmware compiled from source instead of the rockchip idbLoader.

This PKGBUILD is intended to be built directly on the RockPro, but can be cross compiled as well, both methods have been tried and proved working.
